# Project Overview:

In this project, I conducted the following tasks:

# Data Cleaning:
To ensure the dataset's integrity and readiness for analysis, I meticulously performed a series of data cleaning procedures. This involved handling missing values, addressing outliers, standardizing data formats, and resolving any inconsistencies or inaccuracies present within the dataset. By diligently cleaning the data, I aimed to eliminate any potential biases or errors that could adversely impact the subsequent analysis.

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
With the dataset prepared, I embarked on an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) journey. This phase involved employing various statistical and visualization techniques to gain profound insights into the dataset's characteristics, distributions, patterns, and relationships between variables. Through EDA, I sought to uncover hidden trends, detect outliers, identify correlations, and gather a comprehensive understanding of the underlying structure of the data.

# Linear Regression:
Model 1:
In this stage, I initiated the regression analysis by constructing a basic linear regression model using two carefully selected predictors. The aim was to establish a fundamental understanding of the relationship between the independent and dependent variables within the dataset.

Model 2:
Building upon the foundation laid by Model 1, I proceeded to expand the scope of the regression analysis. Here, I incorporated all available predictors from the dataset into the regression model. By encompassing a broader range of predictors, the goal was to capture a more comprehensive understanding of the underlying factors influencing the dependent variable.

Ridge Regression:
Model 3:
Recognizing the potential for multicollinearity and overfitting in the regression models, I introduced Ridge Regression as a regularization technique. By adding a penalty term to the regression model, Ridge Regression helps mitigate the effects of multicollinearity and improves the model's generalization performance. Implementing Ridge Regression aimed to enhance the robustness and stability of the regression analysis, thereby yielding more reliable and interpretable results.

# Model Comparison:
With all three regression models in place, I proceeded to meticulously compare their performance. This involved evaluating various metrics such as R-squared, Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Cross-Validation scores to assess the predictive accuracy, goodness-of-fit, and generalization capabilities of each model. Through comprehensive analysis and interpretation of the results, I identified and selected the optimal model that best suited the dataset's characteristics and provided meaningful insights into the relationship between the variables.
